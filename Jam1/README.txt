goal: collect coins in infinite generated level until you die for high score
controls: wasd-movement (gotta hold it down to start moving)
space- jump
left shift- switch gravity
enter- restart the level (little quicker than reloading the whole game but gravity still is reversed and not sure if there are any other bugs with that, mostly just for convenience for testing, not exactly a player mechanic)
esc- close the game

# Game-Dev-2-Game-Jams
A collection of all Game Jams I participated in for Game Dev 2. Most of these were in repositories made by others, so I moved them here for the portfolio.
Below is a list of my respective contributions for each game.

Game 1 (arcade platformer):
I was in charge of creating the inital spawning system for the platforms, which had two goals:
 1.) every platmorm must be within jumping distance of another platfrom, and 2.) it must present a proper challenge to the player.
 The resulting spawner fulfilled both requirements, but it was considered too difficult for the camera to follow since there were no bounds limiting the spawns.
 Therefore, it was simplified into the final product by myself and another group member, which has set spawn locations.
I was also in charge of implementing the gravity swap mechanic.

Game 2 (on-rails first person shooter):
I was responsible for ensuring that the minecart (and by extension the player) would proceed along an arbitrary track at a set speed, where the speed could easily be changed later in development.
If the track was changed for any reason, it was expected that my code would function the same regardless.
I also contributed to the initial design phase, where I suggusted the track-based movement. In addition contributed to general debugging involving damage values and the enemy AI.

Game 3 (horror game):
During the inital concept phase, I was the one who suggested the use of keys and the idea that ghosts would only attack in the dark.
During development I was responsible for level design, including the map layout, enemy placement and patrol paths, and location of progression items.
Note that I did not actually create the level, merely planned it out;
the group member in charge of environmental design/art direction/lighting was the one who built it with my input.
My duty was to ensure that the game was laid out in such a way as to put stress upon the player without presenting too high of a challenge.
I also wrote the script that made certain lights flicker in a noticeable but "non-epileptic" way.
As per usual, I assisted in debugging, mostly involving the movement of the clocks in the level and lighting issues.

Game 4 (RPG/rougue-lite first person shooter):
I was the one who created most of the inital concept of the game, including: concept, core gameplay, setting, progression, all attack and defensive spells, certain enemies,
and general art direction, as well as several concepts that were removed from the final product (such as potions).
During development I was the one who implemented all attack spell mechanics, including dealing damage, inflicting knockback, and implementing level progression.
Unfortunately, the majority of my work (namely creating and implementing spell talents and status effects)
was removed late in development due to not being able to implement a proper UI for it before the deadline and it being deemed ultimately unnecessary.
As the lead designer, I was also involved in deciding the visual effects for the enemies, spells, and UI.
I once again was involved in degugging, this time involving knockback causing issues with the enemy AI and the spell cooldowns breaking after a change to how player stats were tracked.
